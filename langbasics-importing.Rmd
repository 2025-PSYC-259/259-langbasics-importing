# R Language basics

- Calculation and assignment 

- Calling functions 

- Storing data in tibbles 
 
- Extending the R language with packages 


---

`r chunk_reveal("calc_vs_assign", break_type = "auto", widths = c(4, 1))`

```{r calc_vs_assign, include = FALSE}
# R can run simple calculations
1 + 1 
4^2

# Calculations aren't useful unless we put the results somewhere 
# The assignment operator stores the result into a variable

two <- 1 + 1
two

# Once assigned, variables can be modified by re-assigning a new value to them

two <- 1 + 3
two

# Variables can be removed from the workspace with rm
# After removing two, calling it again would lead to an error 
rm(two)

# Variables can be reused in expressions to calculate new variables/outputs
var1 <- 5
var2 <- 10
var3 <- var1 + var2

# When assigning variables, nothing prints to the console 
# Let's use the function print

print(var3)
```
---

`r chunk_reveal("functions", break_type = "auto", widths = c(4, 1))`

```{r functions, include = FALSE}
# Print and rm are functions that we use in R 
# We call functions by writing their name followed   
# by a list of arguments in parentheses

abs(-1)
mean(var1, var2)
sum(var1, var2, var3)

# c is a function that combines values together
my_vars <- c(var1, var2, var3)
my_vars

# RStudio has built-in help for every function
?c

ds <- read.csv('data_raw/vocab16.csv')
print(ds)

# Base R refers to the collection of default functions
# When we want to use functions to expand R, we
# need to use libary to load packages

library(readr) #for read_csv
ds <- read_csv('data_raw/vocab16.csv')
```
---

# read_csv versus read.csv

- read.csv is base R, read_csv is tidyverse

- read_csv is faster

- read_csv makes fewer assumptions about your data

- read_csv can combine multiple data files into one

---

`r chunk_reveal("import_multiple", break_type = "auto", widths = c(1.5, 1))`

```{r import_multiple, include = FALSE}
# Each file contains data for 2-week intervals
dir('data_raw') #function for listing a directory

# This is slow and tedious!
ds12 <- read_csv('data_raw/vocab12.csv')
ds12.5 <- read_csv('data_raw/vocab12.5.csv')
ds13.5 <- read_csv('data_raw/vocab13.5.csv')
ds_all <- bind_rows(ds12, ds12.5, ds13.5)
print(ds_all)

# read_csv can read a list of files!
full_file_names <- dir('data_raw', full.names = TRUE)
ds_all <- read_csv(full_file_names)
print(ds_all)
```
---

# What's a tibble? 

- Tibbles are the tidyverse equivalent of base R data frames. 

- A tibble/data frame is a rectangular data spreadsheet, with columns of variables and rows of observations

- Tibbles/data frames will always appear in the "Data" section of the RStudio environment

- If you click on the blue "play" button on a tibble in your RStudio environment, you can view a tibble

- Unlike in Excel, you cannot edit the values. This is a feature, not a bug!

- `ds$variable` lets you access one variable of a data set

---

# Why did we need full.names? 

- Our working directory is:

`/Users/johnfranchak/Documents/GitHub-259-2022/259-langbasics-importing`

- Our data is in a subdirectory `/data_raw`

- `dir('data_raw')` gives `vocab12.csv`, `vocab12.5.csv`...which aren't in the working directory

- `dir('data_raw', full.names = TRUE)` gives the absolute path:

`/Users/johnfranchak/Documents/GitHub-259-2022/259-langbasics-importing/data_raw/vocab12.csv`

---

`r chunk_reveal("tibble", break_type = "auto", widths = c(1.5, 1))`

```{r tibble, include = FALSE}
# Find the minimum and maximum ages
min(ds_all$age)
max(ds_all$age)

# Create a new column in a dataset
ds_all$ppt_name <- "Jonah"
print(ds_all)

# Create a calculated column
ds_all$age_round <- round(ds_all$age)
print(ds_all)

# Let's write the combined data to disk
write_csv(ds_all, file = "data_cleaned/vocab_combined.csv")
```

---

# Useful readr capabilities

- read_csv(), read_tsv(), read_delim() are tailored to different inputs (also write_csv(), write_tsv(), write_delim() for saving data)

- Important read_*() arguments are:
  * `col_names = TRUE` (reads column names from first line by default)
  * `col_names = FALSE` (treats the first line as data)
  * `col_names = c("col1name", "col2name")` (to specify the names)
  * `col_types = NULL` (by default, guesses the data type)
  * `col_types = "ccDin"` (specify types character/date/integer/number)
  * `skip = 10` (skip the first 10 lines)

---

`r chunk_reveal("read_options", break_type = "rotate", float = "none", widths = c(5, 1))`

```{r read_options, include = FALSE}
f <- "data_cleaned/vocab_combined.csv"
n <- c("AGE", "WORD", "NAME", "MONTH")
t <- "cccc"
ds <- read_csv(file = f) #ROTATE
ds <- read_csv(file = f, col_names = F) #ROTATE
ds <- read_csv(file = f, col_names = n) #ROTATE
ds <- read_csv(file = f, col_names = n, skip = 1) #ROTATE
ds <- read_csv(file = f, col_names = n, col_types = t, skip = 1) #ROTATE
print(ds)
```
